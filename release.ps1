Release PDFBoss: bump the version everywhere, build the C++ app, the
installer and the portable zip, commit and push the bump, publish a GitHub
release with both assets, then reinstall locally.

Usage:
  .\release.ps1 1.3.13
  .\release.ps1 1.3.13 -NotesFile notes.md      # release notes from a file
  .\release.ps1 1.3.13 -Notes "- fixed X"       # inline release notes
  .\release.ps1 1.3.13 -SkipInstall             # don't reinstall/relaunch here

Without -Notes/-NotesFile the GitHub notes are auto-generated from commits.

Builds PDFBossCpp (C++20 / wxWidgets / MuPDF).  The Python app is deprecated
and is NOT built here; its build path is guarded off deliberately, because it
would produce the same two asset names and downgrade every install.

Requires: cmake, Visual Studio 18 (2026) toolset v145, a built MuPDF at
C:\source\mupdf (see README), Inno Setup 6, gh (authenticated), git.
Windows PowerShell 5.1 compatible.
