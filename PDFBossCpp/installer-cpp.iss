; Inno Setup script for PDFBoss (C++ build).
;
; Build with:  iscc PDFBossCpp\installer-cpp.iss
; Requires the app to be built first:
;   cmake --preset windows-static && cmake --build build --config Release
;
; Produces installer\PDFBoss-Setup.exe.  Releases also ship
; installer\PDFBoss-Portable.zip (just the exe plus HELP.md, zipped);
; release.ps1 does the whole cycle -- see the README's build section.
;
; NOTE the asset name.  PDFBoss-Setup.exe is exactly what every installed
; copy polls for.  Copies from before the rename (v2.3.0 and earlier) poll
; for PDFSherpa-Setup.exe instead, so release.ps1 also attaches this same
; installer under that old name -- see the bridge note there.  The old
; installer.iss at the repo root refuses to run without an explicit override,
; so the deprecated Python build can never produce either file by accident.

; The app was called "PDF Sherpa" until v2.4.0, and with no AppId set Inno
; takes AppName as the id.  Pinned to the OLD name so this installer is the
; same product to Windows: it upgrades an existing install in place (same
; uninstall entry, same folder via UsePreviousAppDir) instead of planting a
; second copy beside it.  Never change this value.

; Per-user, no elevation -- deliberately NOT the workspace default of
; per-machine-with-a-dialog, and this must not be "corrected" in this release.
;
; The v2.0.0 release is a MIGRATION release: it is applied by the updater
; built into the deprecated Python app, which every existing install is still
; running.  That updater invokes the installer as
;
;     "<setup>" /VERYSILENT /NORESTART /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES
;
; with no install-scope flag, because install_scope_flag did not exist when it
; shipped.  Against PrivilegesRequired=admin that silent run either fails to
; elevate, or elevates and installs to {commonpf}\PDF Sherpa while the
; existing copy stays in {userpf}\PDF Sherpa -- a second copy, with the old
; one still polling for updates.  Either way the migration breaks, for every
; existing user, silently.
;
; {autopf} under PrivilegesRequired=lowest resolves to {userpf}
; (%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs), which is exactly where the Python installer put
; it, so the update lands on top of the existing install as intended.
;
; WHEN TO CHANGE THIS: once a release has shipped that everyone is running the
; C++ updater from, this can become PrivilegesRequired=admin plus
; PrivilegesRequiredOverridesAllowed=dialog.  That updater passes
; /ALLUSERS or /CURRENTUSER matching where the running exe actually lives --
; see install_scope_flag in PDFBossCpp\app\Updater.cpp, which exists for
; this and is tested for it.  Do not make that change in the same release
; that migrates people onto it.
