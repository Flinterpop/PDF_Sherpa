# PDF Sherpa — Help

PDF Sherpa lets you browse a folder of PDFs **by topic** and read them in a
built-in viewer.

## The three panes

- **PDFs** (left) — every PDF found under the current folder, grouped by
  subfolder. Click one to open it. The search box filters the list as you type.
- **Topics** (middle) — the selected PDF's topic list. Click a topic to jump
  straight to that page. The search box filters the topics as you type.
- **Viewer** (right) — the embedded page view, with a search box that finds
  text inside the open PDF (see **Searching** below).

## Adding PDFs

**Drag and drop** one or more PDF files anywhere onto the window. Each is
copied into an `inbox` subfolder of the current folder, a topics file is
generated automatically, and the last one is selected and opened for you.

## Topic (.toc) files

Every PDF can have a companion topics file with the same base name — for
example `manual.pdf` pairs with `manual.toc`. If a PDF has none, it shows as
`(no metadata)`. Press **Refresh** (or `F5`) and choose to build topic lists:
Sherpa reads each PDF's bookmarks, or falls back to detecting headings from the
text when there are no bookmarks.

A `.toc` is a plain text file you can edit by hand — the page is the trailing
number, so topics may contain colons and dashes:

```
# comments start with '#'
Introduction: 1
Chapter 1 - Setup: 5
Advanced Topics: 42
```

Page numbers are **1-based** (page 1 is the first page).

## Choosing a folder

Use **Choose folder…** to point Sherpa at any folder of PDFs. It remembers
which subfolders you left open, your window size, and the last PDF you were
reading — and returns you to the page you left off on.

## Searching

Each pane has its own search box:

- **PDFs** — filters the file list by name as you type; folders with no
  matches are hidden.
- **Topics** — filters the current PDF's topic list as you type.
- **Viewer** — searches the **text of the open PDF**. Matches are highlighted
  in yellow on the page, with the current match outlined in orange, and the
  counter shows where you are (for example `2 / 17`). Use the **▲ / ▼**
  buttons — or `Enter` / `Shift+Enter` in the box, or `F3` / `Shift+F3`
  anywhere — to step between matches; stepping wraps around at the end.
  `Ctrl+F` focuses the box. Searches are case-insensitive.

Press the **✕** button to clear a search. Filters stay applied when you switch
PDFs — a content search re-runs against the new document but stays on your
page until you step to a match.

## Viewer controls

- **Prev / Next** buttons, or the arrow keys, to page through the document.
- **+ / −** to zoom; **Fit width** and **Full page** to fit the page. Your fit
  choice is remembered and re-applied when you resize the window.
- The mouse wheel scrolls the page and flips to the next or previous page when
  you scroll past the bottom or top edge.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Left / Page Up | Previous page |
| Right / Page Down / Space | Next page |
| Home / End | First / last page |
| + / = / - | Zoom in / out |
| W | Fit width |
| P | Full page |
| Ctrl+F | Focus the content search box |
| F3 / Shift+F3 | Next / previous search match |
| Enter / Shift+Enter (in search box) | Next / previous search match |
| F5 | Refresh PDF list |

Arrow, space, and page keys defer to the PDF and topic lists while one of them
has keyboard focus, so you can still navigate the lists from the keyboard.
